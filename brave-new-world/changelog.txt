Version: 3.2.0
Date: 15. 03. 2019
  Changes:
    - NOTE: Poles/underneathies/underpipes can no longer be drag-placed. It was a hack that I've now removed in the hope of the devs adding this functionality to the ghost cursor.
	- Fixed issue with disappearing items in some cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.1.0
Date: 11. 03. 2019

    - Replaced blueprints of items with ghost cursor (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Allow copy/paste tool (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Support migration of save games pre 0.17 (github.com/asdfuser)

Version: 3.0.0
Date: 03. 03. 2019
  Changes:
    - Updated for Factorio 0.17 (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Allow 0.17 upgrade-planner to be used (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Remove inventory of rail signals, trains, wagons, landfil and cliff-explosives since 0.17 can place those just fine (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Added gun turrets as the locals are more aggressive in 0.17 (github.com/asdfuser)
    - German localization (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Tweaked starting equipment (Assembler 1 instead of Assembler 3, slightly more chests/inserters/splitters/underground belts) (canidae)
  Bugs:
    - I was able to duplicate power poles. Not sure if that is new (github.com/asdfuser)
    - Integration with the ghost cursor is missing, so the blueprints will still clutter your inventory (github.com/asdfuser)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 17. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - Major overhaul of code.
    - Instead of carrying one of each items, you get blueprints of placeable structures. There are some exceptions, like power poles and underground pipes (but not underground belts, as these cause issues). These exceptions exist to improve the game experience, such as placing power poles at max distance.
    - Scenario now provides an "Upgrade Planner". In the deconstruction planner, place items you're upgrading from on the second row, and items you're upgrading to on third row, directly below. See mod page for more details.

    - Changed scenario name to include "BNW <version>" and not just version number. This is due to how custom scenarios are displayed (it would only show version number).

Version: 1.0.0
